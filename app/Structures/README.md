# JSON Model Structures Directory

If you didn't change the path in 'model_structures' at database.php configuration
file, this is the directory where you must put the JSON files for columns structure
of the models application.

The files must be named like tables with `.json` extension.

Then for table named `users` you must create a file named `users.json`.
